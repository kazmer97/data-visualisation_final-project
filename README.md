Group 11 Proposal for Final Group Project

Our database contains information about all astronauts who participated in space missions before 15 January 2020. The data is collected from NASA, Roscosmos, and other related websites. 

There are 22 columns in the data. The columns include astronaut name, sex, date of birth, nationality, military status, occupation, information about each mission such as mission durations and mission year. 


What issues or questions are you addressing? 

Countries: 
Which countries are dominant?
Is there a country that is significantly increasing the number of astronauts? (New entry to market kind of thinking)

Background of Astronauts: 
Age: 
Age of astronauts possibly by country
Which countries send the youngest/oldest people to space?
What’s the age trend of astronauts: are more young people becoming astronauts?

Gender:
Which countries have more female astronauts
Female/male ratio over time

Occupation:
Distribution of occupation and status of the astronauts 

Missions:
What do typical missions look like? 
How long do they stay in orbit? 
How long do they get out of the spaceship for? 
Which teams have stayed the longest? 

Missions by periods of time ⇒ are there moments where space missions were popular / moments when no one was in space ? 

Total mission duration over time, possibly faceted by gender or country
Duration of extravehicular activities during the mission (eva_hrs_mission) over time, possibly faceted by gender or country

What statistical techniques do you think you may be using? 

Some statistical techniques that we will use are confidence intervals and hypothesis testing to accompany our visualizations and show significance.  

Clustering to determine if there are distinct types of astronauts we can identify.

Explore correlations between space agency and rocket technology used between the length of mission and space walks.

Possibly a model to predict/understand how factors like country, age, etc affect/predict the number of missions an astronaut will go on.
